Network VAPT Resources

To build a strong foundation in networking, consider the following key concepts:
1.	OSI Model: Begin by studying the seven layers of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model. This framework helps understand network communication and identifies which layer each device operates on. 
2.	Internet Protocol (IP): Learn about IP addresses, their structure, and the different classes (A, B, C, D, and E). Understanding IP addressing is crucial for network communication.
3.	NAT and CIDR: Explore Network Address Translation (NAT) and Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR). These concepts are essential for efficient IP address management and network design.
4.	Subnetting: Delve into subnetting techniques, which allow for the division of larger networks into smaller, more manageable subnetworks.
5.	Ports and Protocols: Study various network ports and protocols. This knowledge is vital for understanding how different applications and services communicate over networks.
6.	Common Ports and Services: Familiarize yourself with frequently used ports and the default services associated with them. This information is crucial for network configuration and troubleshooting.
7.	Network Devices and Security: Learn about essential network devices such as firewalls, switches, and routers. Additionally, understand the concept of a Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) and its role in network security.
